When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository may be useful when working on a project that you would want to share with other people online, or, an open-source project.Otherwise, keeping the work local would be useful for working on a private project that nobody else should see.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes manually allows the user to always know what updates they are aquiring, meaning, there won't be a chance of an unknown update suddenly showing up on Git, as this may cause problems.
